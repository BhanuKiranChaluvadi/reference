# TwinCAT Terminology

Below is a table explaining various terms and abbreviations used in the TwinCAT development environment (`TcXaeShell`):

| Abbreviation   | Explanation                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DUT            | Data User Type - custom data types like structures or enumerations.                                          |
| FB             | Function Block - reusable code with an internal state.                                                       |
| FC             | Function - similar to FBs but without internal state.                                                        |
| GVLs           | Global Variable Lists - lists containing globally accessible variables.                                      |
| ITFs           | Interfaces - define a set of functions and methods to be implemented.                                        |
| N0_E01/N0_E02  | Likely specific variable or instance names; may be project-specific.                                         |
| POVs           | Process Object Variables (contextual; might not be a standard TwinCAT abbreviation).                         |
| POUsImplicits  | Program Organization Units Implicits - blocks of code like functions, FBs, or programs; "Implicits" may be default or automatically included units. |
| Sequence       | Refers to a sequence of operations or steps, like in sequence programming.                                  |
| VISUs          | Visualizations - graphical interfaces for interaction or monitoring.                                         |
