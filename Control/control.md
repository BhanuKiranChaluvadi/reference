This document explains how to control a binary heater (ON/OFF) smoothly and precisely using a combination of:

1. 🔼 **Ramp control** to define a gradual temperature increase.
2. 🧠 **PID control** to track the difference between actual and target temperature.
3. ⚡ **PWM output** to convert PID power into ON/OFF heater activation.
4. 🔂 **Bang-Bang control** (comparison case) to show the simplest ON/OFF control method.

### 🔼 Ramp Generator
The ramp generator defines a **time-dependent setpoint** that increases linearly over time. It is used to guide the system from an initial temperature to a desired final temperature in a controlled manner. This helps prevent sudden temperature jumps which can stress or damage system components.

This diagram shows how data flows through the control system:
- **Ramp Setpoint** is updated periodically.
- **PID** continuously tracks the difference between setpoint and actual temperature.
- **PWM** converts PID power to ON time.
- **Heater** switches ON/OFF accordingly.

### 🔼 Ramp Generator
The ramp generator defines a **time-dependent setpoint** that increases linearly over time. It is used to guide the system from an initial temperature to a desired final temperature in a controlled manner. This helps prevent sudden temperature jumps which can stress or damage system components.

#### Example:
- Initial Temperature: 25°C
- Target Temperature: 50°C
- Ramp Rate: 10°C/min = 0.167°C/sec

The ramped setpoint at any moment `t` (in seconds) is calculated as:
```python
ramp_setpoint = T_start + ramp_rate * elapsed_time
```
The ramp ensures that the temperature target evolves gradually, regardless of system lag.

### 🧠 PID Controller
The PID controller takes the current **error** (the difference between the ramped setpoint and actual temperature) and computes a **control effort**:

```python
error = ramp_setpoint - actual_temperature
```

This error is processed using the PID formula:
```python
output = Kp * error + Ki * integral(error) + Kd * derivative(error)
```
Where:
- `Kp`: proportional gain
- `Ki`: integral gain
- `Kd`: derivative gain

The output is usually constrained between 0% (heater OFF) and 100% (heater full ON), and it represents the **demanded power level**.

### ⚡ PWM Controller
The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controller converts the PID output into **time-based ON/OFF switching** of the heater.

#### Key Concept:
- A fixed **PWM window** is defined (e.g., 5 seconds)
- The **heater ON duration** in each window is:
```python
ON_time = PWM_period * (PID_output / 100)
```
- For the rest of the window, the heater is OFF

This method allows for power modulation using a binary actuator (relay, SSR, etc.), and is especially suitable for systems with thermal inertia.

### 🔂 Bang-Bang Controller (ON/OFF Control)
This is the simplest form of control. The heater is turned ON when the temperature is below the setpoint and OFF when it is above. Optionally, hysteresis is used to avoid rapid switching:

```python
if temperature < setpoint - hysteresis:
    heater = ON
elif temperature > setpoint + hysteresis:
    heater = OFF
```

#### 🔍 Bang-Bang Control Algorithm:
```python
setpoint = 50.0
hysteresis = 0.5

while True:
    temperature = read_temperature()

    if temperature < setpoint - hysteresis:
        heater = ON
    elif temperature > setpoint + hysteresis:
        heater = OFF
    
    set_heater(heater)
    sleep(0.2)  # control loop every 200ms
```

Bang-bang control is effective in systems with high inertia and no need for precise control rate.

### 🕒 Time vs Setpoint vs PID vs PWM Output

|----------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 0        | 25.0                   | 25.0                 | 100            | 5.0              | ON             |
| 5        | 25.8                   | 27.0                 | 95             | 4.75             | ON             |
| 10       | 26.7                   | 29.5                 | 90             | 4.5              | ON             |
| 15       | 27.5                   | 32.0                 | 85             | 4.25             | ON             |
| 20       | 28.3                   | 34.0                 | 75             | 3.75             | ON             |
| 25       | 29.2                   | 36.0                 | 65             | 3.25             | ON             |
| 30       | 30.0                   | 38.0                 | 55             | 2.75             | ON             |

> ⚠️ Note: The PID loop runs frequently (e.g., every 200 ms), but PWM only updates at the start of each 5-second window. The ON duration is fixed during that window.

### 📈 Temperature Control Comparison Graph (Markdown Example)

```markdown
![Temperature Control Comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image-link-placeholder.png)
```

This hypothetical plot illustrates how the system temperature behaves under different control strategies:

- 🔴 **Bang-Bang**: Wide oscillations around the setpoint due to binary switching.
- 🔵 **PID Only**: Smooth tracking but may overshoot or oscillate slightly.
- 🟢 **Ramp + PID + PWM**: Smooth, controlled rise with minimal overshoot and precise regulation.

(You can generate this plot using any plotting tool such as matplotlib, Excel, or online simulators.)

## 🛠️ How to Choose Control Parameters

### 🔧 Ramp Rate
- **Too fast**: PID can't keep up, causes overshoot.
- **Too slow**: Inefficient.
- Choose based on system's thermal inertia.

### 🔧 PID Loop Time
- Should be **faster than ramp update rate**.
- Typical: 100–200 ms.
- Ensures PID can respond to small disturbances and system changes.

### 🔧 PWM Period
| System Type       | Recommended PWM Period |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Mechanical Relay  | ≥ 5s                    |
| Solid-State Relay | 1–5s                   |
| MOSFETs / Fast SSR| 200–500 ms             |

> ⚠️ Long PWM periods provide finer control granularity but slower response.
