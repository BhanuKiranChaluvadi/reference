== Code Snippets

[TIP]
====
We should `enable_testing` before `add_subdirectory` and also nice to only include the tests subfolder only when tests are ON
[source,cmake]
----
option(PACKAGE_TESTS "Build the tests" ON)
if(PACKAGE_TESTS)
    enable_testing()
    include(GoogleTest)
    add_subdirectory(tests)
endif()
