# Video Streaming Guide

This guide provides an overview of key concepts in video streaming technology including encoding, container formats, and streaming protocols. It also includes a simple line diagram to illustrate the flow of video streaming.

## Encoding (Video Codecs)

**Encoding**, or **video compression**, is the process of converting raw video input into a digital format that takes up less storage space and bandwidth. This is done using various algorithms that reduce redundancies in video data, allowing videos to be efficiently stored and transmitted over networks. The result of encoding video is a stream of compressed data that can be decoded (played back) by compatible devices.


### Common Video Codecs:
- **H.264 (AVC)**: Advanced Video Coding, widely supported, known for good video quality at low bitrates.
- **H.265 (HEVC)**: High Efficiency Video Coding, known for better compression ratios, suitable for 4K content.
- **VP8/VP9**: Open video codecs by Google. VP9 is better for high-resolution videos.
- **AV1**: Newest codec designed to be more efficient and royalty-free.

## Container Formats

A **container** or wrapper format is used to store the encoded video along with audio, metadata, subtitles, etc., in a single file or stream. The container manages the different types of data within it and ensures that they are kept in sync during playback.

### Common Container Formats:
- **MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)**: Supports multiple codecs, widely used for its compatibility.
- **WebM**: Optimized for the web, supports VP8/VP9 video codecs.
- **MKV (Matroska)**: Highly flexible, supports almost any codec.
- **AVI**: Older format, supports multiple streams of audio and video.

## Streaming Protocols

**Streaming protocols** define how data is transmitted across a network. They play a crucial role in how effectively and efficiently video is streamed from servers to clients.

### Common Streaming Protocols:
- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**
- **DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)**
- **RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)**
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**

## Protocol Comparison Table

|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| HLS      | HTTP-based, breaks video into chunks | Broad compatibility, streaming |
| DASH     | Adaptive streaming over HTTP         | Quality adaptive streams     |
| RTMP     | Real-time streaming                  | Live broadcasting            |
| WebRTC   | Real-time communication              | Live interactions, peer-to-peer |
