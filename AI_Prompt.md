Here's an improved version of the README file:
# Project Assistant

This project provides strategies for refactoring, restructuring, and implementing code logic efficiently through interactive prompts. The following strategies can be used to guide the development process:

### Strategy #1: Q&A Strategy Prompt

**Usage:**
```bash
@workspace propose a file/folder structure for this project. Ask me a series of yes/no questions that will help you provide a better recommendation.
```

### Strategy #2: Pros and Cons Prompt

**Usage:**
```bash
What are the different ways that I can implement this db connection logic? Give me pros and cons of each strategy. #file:db.ts
```

**Follow-up:**
Once you've selected an option:
```bash
Rewrite the code as <singleton> #file:db.ts
```

**Additional Example:**
After refactoring, you'll be provided with an example to show how to use the refactored code in your application.
```bash
Provide an example of how to use this in the application.
```

### Strategy #3: Stepwise Chain of Thought Prompt

**Usage:**
```bash
Help me refactor the code in #file:VehicleService.ts. Go one step at a time. Do not move to the next step until I give the keyword "next". Begin.
```

### Strategy #4: Role Prompt

**Usage:**
```bash
You are a skilled instructor who makes complex topics easy to understand. You can come up with fun exercises so that your students can learn by doing. Your goal is to teach students to be proficient with regex. Move one step at a time and wait for the student to provide the correct answer before you move on to the next concept. If the student provides the wrong answer, give them a hint. Begin.
```
